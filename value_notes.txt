Notes on API parameters and value thresholds

DATAPOINT API (Weather monitoring):
York Location ID: 310169

JSON FORMAT:
      Care about params:
          Wind: G (Gust), S (Speed)
          Rain and Snow and Electrical Storms: W (Weather Type):
            RAIN: W=12 (Light rain) or W=13 (Heavy rain)
            SNOW: W=24 (Light snow) or W=27 (Heavy snow)
            ELECTRICAL STORMS: W=29 (Thunder shower day) or W=30 (Thunder)
          Feels Like Temp: F
          Visibility: V. Also consider W=5 or W=6 (mist or fog)
            V=VP => RED, V=PO => Amber

      Range of values:
          WIND SPEED (S):
            Green: 0-24mph. Amber: 24mph - 35mph. Red: >35mph.
          WIND GUST (G):
            Green: 0-30mph. Amber: 30mph - 40mph. Red: >40mph.
          WEATHER TYPE (W):
            RAIN:
              Amber: Raining but not actually much of an issue (W=12). Red: >30mm per hour (W=13)
            SNOW:
              Green: No Snow. Amber: Moderate Snow. (W=24) Red: Heavy Snow that impedes visibility (W=27)
            ELECTRICAL STORMS:
              Red if any electrical storms (W=29 or W=30)
          FEELS LIKE TEMP (F):
            Green: 0-30c. Amber: >30c or 0 -> -6c, -7c -> -8c Red: <-8c or >40c
          VISIBILITY (V):
            Green: Good visibility. Amber: 250m visibility. (V=PO) Red: 5m visibility (V=VP)

Doing a 3-hourly 5 day forecast means I can use:
Current values (item 0)
Values in 3 hours (iemm 1)
Values in 6 hours (item 2)
Values in 12 hours (item 5)
Values in 24 hours (9)
Values in 48 hours (17)

SiteRep -> DV -> Period -> [DAY] -> [VALUE SET]
Essentially want the Rep values for the times listed above
And then extract the useful data from them
